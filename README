Phase 1:

1. I have different code segments for different queries, each in "Solver.py" in the respective query's forlder.
2. In query 6, I have assumed to check for any player, i.e he can be in any of the teams. If I get atleast 1 such player, that match satifies the query.
3. In query 9, I have assumed that I have to check that for any right handed bowler in a match, his number of wickets are more than the left handed bowler who has taken highest number of wickets in that match.
4. The output of all the queries is there in the "output" file.

Phase 2:

Part 2 ->

1. Go to the phase2 folder.
2. run python check.py
3. Enter the query.
